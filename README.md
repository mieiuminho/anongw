## :rocket: Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

Start by filling out the environment variables defined in the `.env` file. Use
the `.env.sample` as a starting point.

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

After this, you must fill in the fields correctly and export them in your
environment. Checkout [direnv](https://direnv.net/) for your shell and
[EnvFile](https://github.com/Ashald/EnvFile) for IntelliJ.
